### Description

Script to collect player information from the **kog.tw** website and save the data locally as **JSON** or **TXT**.

---

```bash
npm install puppeteer
```

```bash
node script.js
```

### Important

* If the player **does not exist** or the site takes too long to respond, the script will automatically terminate.
This may happen during the first few runs of the script try increasing the timeout if the error persists.

* With newest maps may dont work.

* Just take the newest races.
